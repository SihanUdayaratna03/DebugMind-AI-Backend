    Please structure your final report precisely as follows:
    
    ### 🧠 AI Agent Thought Process
    (Write a brief reasoning of how the agent used the tools to reach the conclusion)
    
    ### 🚨 Detected Errors
    (List all bugs and syntax issues detected)
    
    ### 💡 Technical Explanation
    (Clearly explain WHY these are issues in single, simple sentences)
    
    ### 🛠️ Fixed Source Code
    (Provide the fully corrected and optimized version in a markdown code block)
    
    ### 🚀 Best Practices & Optimization
    (Suggest 2-3 ways to improve the code beyond just fixing it)
